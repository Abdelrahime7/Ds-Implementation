# Data Structures in C++

[](https://github.com/Abdelrahime7/Ds-Implementation#data-structures-in-c)

This repository contains step-by-step implementations of fundamental data structures using **C++**.  
The goal is to provide clean, well-documented code that demonstrates how each structure works internally, rather than relying solely on STL containers.

The project is organized by data structure, each in its own folder:

- **Stack**
    
    - Implemented using `std::vector`
    - Demonstrates push, pop, top, size, and clear operations
- **Queue**
    
    - Array-based implementation
    - Linked list implementation
- **Linked List**
    
    - Singly linked list
    - Doubly linked list
    - Operations: insert, delete, search, traverse
- **Tree**
    
    - Binary tree basics
    - Binary search tree (BST)
    - Traversals: inorder, preorder, postorder
- **Graph**
    
    - Adjacency list representation
    - Depth-first search (DFS)
    - Breadth-first search (BFS)
- **Other Structures**
    
    - Hash table basics
    - Priority queue (heap)
