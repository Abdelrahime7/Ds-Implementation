# Data Structures in C++

This repository contains step-by-step implementations of fundamental data structures using **C++**.  
The goal is to provide clean, well-documented code that demonstrates how each structure works internally, rather than relying solely on STL containers.

## 📚 Contents

The project is organized by data structure, each in its own folder:

- **Stack**  
 
  - Implemented using `std::vector`  
  - Demonstrates push, pop, top, size, and clear operations

- **Queue**  
  - Array-based implementation  
  - Linked list implementation  
 

- **Linked List**  
  - Singly linked list  
  - Doubly linked list  
  - Operations: insert, delete, search, traverse

- **Tree**  
  - Binary tree basics  
  - Binary search tree (BST)  
  - Traversals: inorder, preorder, postorder

- **Graph**  
  - Adjacency list representation  
  - Depth-first search (DFS)  
  - Breadth-first search (BFS)

- **Other Structures**  
  - Hash table basics  
  - Priority queue (heap)
